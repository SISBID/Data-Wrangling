1. Download the samples data on the 1,000 genomes project: (https://sisbid.github.io/Data-Wrangling/labs/1000genomes.xlsx).

```{r}

```

2. Open the sheet and look at the information listed. Go to the sheet _Final Phase Sequence Data_

```{r}

```

3. Read the _Final Phase Sequence Data_ sheet. Only read the data for the low coverage samples.  

```{r}

```
4. Calculate total sequence by platform

```{r}

```
5. Do the same thing by sequencing center

```{r}

```
6. Find the subset of samples that passed QC. 
```{r}

```
7. Find the subset that passed QC and came from the BCM center
```{r}

```
8. Calculate the average aligned coverage for each population on the subset of samples that passed QC that came from the BCM. 
```{r}

```
