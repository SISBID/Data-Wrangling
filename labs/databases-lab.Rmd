1. Download and load the nycflights data with the command `install.packages('nycflights13')` and `library(nycflights13)`.

2. Use the `pryr` package to figure out the size of the `flights` object. 

3. Create a sqlite database, then add a table "flights" with the flights data from this package.

4. Inspect the tables using the `src_tbls` command to make sure the copying happened correctly.

5. Find the average delay time for American Airlines (hint: the abbreviation is AA).

6. Can you add a variable for delay time to the database? 

7. How long does it take to collect the results of your computation for 5? 

8. Can you figure out the average delay time for each airline?
