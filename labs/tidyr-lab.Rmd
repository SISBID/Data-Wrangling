1. Load the `readr` package and read in the data on hospitalizations using
`seps <- read_csv("http://www.mm-c.me/mdsi/hospitals93to98.csv")`

2. Look at the data using `View`

3. Gather the years into a single column

4. Now use spread to create two columns out of the `Field` variable one for `PatientDays` and one for `Separations`. 

5. Separate the `Year` variable into a column that shows the abbreviation and a column that shows the year. 

6. Now reunite these two columns, but now include a hyphen between the abbreviation and the year.
