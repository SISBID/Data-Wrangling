# "Real Property Taxes" Dataset 

## Part 1

Download the "real property taxes" dataset from the website (via OpenBaltimore), 
The data is located here (note you don't need to unzip it to read it into R):
http://sisbid.github.io/Module1/data/Real_Property_Taxes.csv.gz
And it is also stored in the RStudio Cloud session.

1. Read the Property Tax data into R and call it the variable `tax`

2. How many addresses pay property taxes? 

3. What is the total city and state tax paid?

4. Subset the data to only retain those houses that are principal residences. 
  a) How many such houses are there?
  b) Describe the distribution of property taxes on these residences.  Use 
  hist with certain breaks or `quantile()`

5. Convert the 'lotSize' variable to a numeric square feet variable. Tips:
* Look at the data 
* Assume hyphens represent inches within square foot meassuremnts 
* Assume decimals within acreage measurements
* 1 acre = 43560 square feet

6. Using `table()` or `group_by()` and `summarize(n())` or `tally()`

  d. What is the 75th percentile of city and state tax paid by Ward? (quantile)
