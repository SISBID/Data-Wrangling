Hi class,

We are only a few days away from our Data Wrangling course!

Before we get started on Monday we have a few things for you to take note of:

1. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the schedule for next week: http://sisbid.github.io/Data-Wrangling/ 

2. Note we will be using a recurring Zoom link for all of our sessions:Â https://jh.zoom.us/j/94559638040?pwd=NEZmMkFHcXBwdk1EYTZBb3VtRWwrQT09.

3. Please take a moment to join Slack if you haven't already. This will be a space for you to meet each other and ask questions as they arise.

4. Finally, it will help us hit the ground running Monday if you can take a moment and create an account on the AnVIL platform (https://anvil.terra.bio/). All you have to do is log in with a Google account. Please DM me (Ava) on Slack to let me know what your Google account is (e.g., your-name@gmail.com). If you need a google account, you can create one here: https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp.

Thanks and see you all soon!

Ava and Carrie
