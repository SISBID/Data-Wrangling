## Joining in `dplyr`

* Merging/joining data sets together - usually on key variables, usually "id"
* `?join` - see different types of joining for `dplyr`
* `inner_join(x, y)` - only rows that match for `x` and `y` are kept
* `full_join(x, y)` - all rows of `x` and `y` are kept 
* `left_join(x, y)` - all rows of `x` are kept even if not merged with `y`
* `right_join(x, y)` - all rows of `y` are kept even if not merged with `x`
* `anti_join(x, y)` - all rows from `x` not in `y` keeping just columns from `x`.

## Merging: Simple Data

```{r echo=FALSE}
data_As <- tibble(State = c("Alabama", "Alaska"),
                 June_vacc_rate = c("37.2%", "47.5%"),
                 May_vacc_rate = c("36.0%", "46.2%"))
data_cold <- tibble(State = c("Maine", "Alaska"),
                    April_vacc_rate = c("32.4%", "41.7%"))
```

```{r}
data_As
data_cold
```

## Inner Join

https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/blob/main/images/inner-join.gif

```{r, fig.alt="A gif showing the inner joining of two simple datasets.", out.width = "40%", echo = FALSE, align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("media/Join_inner-join.gif")
```

## Inner Join

```{r inner_join}
ij = inner_join(data_As, data_cold)
ij
```

## Left Join

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/main/images/left-join.gif

```{r, fig.alt="A gif showing the left joining of two simple datasets.", out.width = "40%", echo = FALSE, align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("media/Join_left-join.gif")
```

## Left Join

```{r left_join}
lj = left_join(data_As, data_cold)
lj
```

## Install `tidylog` package to log outputs

```{r, include=FALSE}
# install.packages("tidylog")
library(tidylog)
```

```{r left_join_log}
# install.packages("tidylog")
library(tidylog)
left_join(data_As, data_cold)
```

## Right Join

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/main/images/right-join.gif

```{r, fig.alt="A gif showing the right joining of two simple datasets.", out.width = "40%", echo = FALSE, align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("media/Join_right-join.gif")
```

## Right Join

```{r right_join}
rj <- right_join(data_As, data_cold)
rj
```

## Left Join: Switching arguments

```{r right_join2}
lj2 <- left_join(data_cold, data_As)
lj2
```

## Full Join

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/main/images/full-join.gif

```{r, fig.alt="A gif showing the full joining of two simple datasets.", out.width = "40%", echo = FALSE, align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("media/Join_full-join.gif")
```

## Full Join

```{r}
fj <- full_join(data_As, data_cold)
fj
```

## Watch out for "`includes duplicates`"

```{r echo=FALSE}
data_As <- tibble(State = c("Alabama", "Alaska"),
                 state_bird = c("wild turkey", "willow ptarmigan"))
data_cold <- tibble(State = c("Maine", "Alaska", "Alaska"),
                    vacc_rate = c("32.4%", "41.7%", "46.2%"),
                    month = c("April", "April", "May"))
```

```{r}
data_As
data_cold
```

## Watch out for "`includes duplicates`"

```{r}
lj <- left_join(data_As, data_cold)
```

## Watch out for "`includes duplicates`"

Data including the joining column ("State") has been duplicated.

```{r}
lj
```

<br>

Note that "Alaska willow ptarmigan" appears twice.

## Watch out for "`includes duplicates`"

https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/blob/main/images/left-join-extra.gif

```{r, fig.alt="A gif showing how data can be duplicated from one dataset when joining two simple datasets.", out.width = "40%", echo = FALSE, align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("media/Join_left_join_extra.gif")
```

## Stop `tidylog`

```{r}
unloadNamespace("tidylog")
```

## Using the `by` argument

By default joins use the intersection of column names. If `by` is specified, it uses that.

```{r use_by}
full_join(data_As, data_cold, by = "State")
```

## Using the `by` argument

You can join based on multiple columns by using something like `by = c(col1, col2)`.

If the datasets have two different names for the same data, use:

```{r eval=FALSE}
full_join(x, y, by = c("a" = "b"))
```

## Using "`setdiff`"

We might want to determine what indexes ARE in the first dataset that AREN'T in the second:

```{r}
data_As
data_cold
```

## Using "`setdiff`"

Use `setdiff` to determine what indexes ARE in the first dataset that AREN'T in the second:

```{r}
A_states <- data_As %>% pull(State)
cold_states <- data_cold %>% pull(State)
```

```{r}
setdiff(A_states, cold_states)
setdiff(cold_states, A_states)
```

## Using `bind_rows()` (`dplyr`)

```{r}
one <- starwars[1:4, ]
two <- starwars[9:12, ]

bind_rows(one, two)
```

## Summary

* Merging/joining data sets together - assumes all column names that overlap
     - use the `by = c("a" = "b")` if they differ
* `inner_join(x, y)` - only rows that match for `x` and `y` are kept
* `full_join(x, y)` - all rows of `x` and `y` are kept 
* `left_join(x, y)` - all rows of `x` are kept even if not merged with `y`
* `right_join(x, y)` - all rows of `y` are kept even if not merged with `x`
* Use the `tidylog` package for a detailed summary
* `setdiff(x, y)` shows what in `x` is missing from `y`
* `bind_rows(x, y)` appends datasets
