## Setting up some options

Let's first turn on the cache for increased performance and improved styling
```{r, cache=FALSE}
# Set some global knitr options
suppressMessages(library("knitr"))
opts_chunk$set(cache = FALSE, messages = FALSE)
```

## R in the NY Times

"Despite" being free and open-source, R is widely used by data analysts inside corporations and academia.

## R is a really mature project

Some of the best R functionalities **ARE NOT** in R-base but come from add-on packages: `knitr`, `ggplot2`, `reshape2`, `Rcpp`, `data.table`, etc.

Some of these packages are available on the following repositories:

- [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org)
- [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org)
- [GitHub](http://github.com)
- [Ropensci](https://ropensci.org)

**Note:** Show how to update the list of repositories to install packages (`setRepositories`). Also talk about biocLite.


## The Bioconductor project

- [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org) is an open source, open development software project to provide tools for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data. It is based primarily on the R programming language.

- Most Bioconductor components are distributed as R packages. The functional scope of Bioconductor packages includes the analysis of microarray, sequencing, flow sorting, genotype/SNP, and other data.

## Project Goals

The broad goals of the Bioconductor project are:

- To provide widespread access to a broad range of powerful statistical and graphical methods for the analysis of genomic data.
- To facilitate the inclusion of biological metadata in the analysis of genomic data, e.g. literature data from PubMed, annotation data from Entrez genes.
- To provide a common software platform that enables the rapid development and deployment of extensible, scalable, and interoperable software.
- To further scientific understanding by producing high-quality documentation and reproducible research.
- To train researchers on computational and statistical methods for the analysis of genomic data.

## Getting started

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Note that this is not evaluated here, so you will have to do it before using this knitr doc
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
# Install all core packages and update all installed packages
biocLite()
```

You can also install specific packages

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Note that this is not evaluated here, so you will have to do it before using this knitr doc

```

## The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)

The [Gene Expression Omnibus](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) is an international public repository that archives and freely distributes microarray, next-generation sequencing, and other forms of high-throughput functional genomics data submitted by the research community.

The three main goals of GEO are to:

- Provide a robust, versatile database in which to efficiently store high-throughput functional genomic data
- Offer simple submission procedures and formats that support complete and well-annotated data deposits from the research community
- Provide user-friendly mechanisms that allow users to query, locate, review and download studies and gene expression profiles of interest

## Getting data from GEO

For individual studies/datasets, the easiest way to find publicly-available data is the GEO accession number found at the end of publications.

![Example Accession in Paper](Images/geo_nature_example.png)

## Getting data from GEO

The details for a particular series can be found on the web interface for GEO, including details on individual samples, and often raw data

![Example Accession on GEO](Images/geo_nature_example_page.png)

## Getting the data we want

We will first create a directory where we will download data:
```{r}
dir.create("../data/geo", recursive = TRUE)
```

Now we can download the data we want using our GSE ID and the GEOquery command, as follows,

```{r query-GEO, cache = TRUE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(GEOquery))
# Download the mapping information and processed data
# This returns a list of eSets
GSE29617_set <- getGEO("GSE29617", destdir = "../data/geo/")[[1]]
```
which returns (a list of) an ExpressionSet (eSet).

## The eSet class

What is an `eSet`? An S4 class that tries to:
- Coordinate high through-put (e.g., gene expression) and phenotype data.
- Provide common data container for diverse Bioconductor packages.

```{r}
str(GSE29617_set, max.level = 2)
```

`str()` is the command to get the internal structure of an R object. 
An eSet contains the necessary "parts" to summarize an experiment.

## Classes and methods

**Everything in R is an OBJECT.**

- A class is the definition of an object.
- A method is a function that performs specific calculations on objects of a
specific class. Generic functions are used to determine the class of its
arguments and select the appropriate method. A generic function is a
function with a collection of methods.
- See ?Classes and ?Methods for more information.

## Classes and methods

```{r}
data(iris)
class(iris)
summary(iris)
```

## Classes and methods

There are two types of classes in R: S3 Classes (old style, informal) and S4 Classes - (new style, more rigorous and formal)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# S3 class
head(methods(class = "data.frame"))
# S4 class
showMethods(classes  = "eSet")
```

## The eSet

You can get a sense of the defined methods for an `eSet` as follows:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(Biobase)
showMethods(classes = "eSet")
```
in particular, the following methods are rather convenient:

- assayData(obj); assayData(obj) `<-` value: access or assign assayData
- phenoData(obj); phenoData(obj) `<-` value: access or assign phenoData
- experimentData(obj); experimentData(obj) `<-` value: access or assign experimentData
- annotation(obj); annotation(obj) `<-` value: access or assign annotation

## The ExpressionSet subclass

Similar to the `eSet` class but tailored to gene expression, with an expression matrix that can be accessed with the `exprs` method.

```{r}
class(GSE29617_set)
exprs(GSE29617_set)[1:2,1:3]
```

also provides additional methods such as `fData`.

## The ExpressionSet subclass

`ExpressionSet` objects are meant to facilitate the adoption of MIAME standard. MIAME = "Minimum Information about a Microarray experiment". Alvis Brazma et. al. (2001) Nature Genetics
Unfortrunately, not all contributors will upload all the information.
```{r}
# Information about preprocessing
# Nothing in here!
preproc(GSE29617_set)
```

## The ExpressionSet subclass

```{r}
# A data.frame with number of rows equal to the number of samples
pData(GSE29617_set)[1:2,1:2]
# A data.frame with number of rows equal to the number of features/probes
fData(GSE29617_set)[1:2,1:2]
```

## The ExpressionSet subclass 

So the `ExpressionSet` objects facilitate the encapsulation of everything that's needed to summarize and analyze an experiment. Specific elements can be access with the `@` operator but many classes have convenient accessor methods.

```{r}
fData(GSE29617_set)[1:2, 1:2]
# Note that S4 classes can be nested!
GSE29617_set@featureData@data[1:2, 1:2]
```

## What if you want the raw data?

GEO also provides access to raw data that can be downloaded with `GEOquery`.


```{r download-raw-data}
# Download all raw data. This should only be evaluated once
# Then the data would be stored locally in the data directory
# Make sure the directory exists
if (length(dir("data/geo/", pattern = "GSE29617")) == 0) {
  getGEOSuppFiles("GSE29617", makeDirectory = TRUE, baseDir = "../data/geo/")
  untar("./data/geo/GSE29617/GSE29617_RAW.tar", exdir = "../data/geo/GSE29617/", 
        tar = Sys.getenv("TAR"))
}
# untar downloaded data
```

## Starting from the raw data

Now that we have the Affymetrix raw data (CEL) files, we can apply some of the concepts we've discussed related to normalization and probe summary. We first need to load the appropriate package


```{r, eval=FALSE}
## In case we haven't downloaded it before.
biocLite("affy")
```

```{r}
library(affy)
```

then we use the following commands
```{r }
# Read the CEL file and creates and AffyBatch
GSE29617_affyBatch <- ReadAffy(celfile.path = "../data/geo/GSE29617/")
# Normalize and summarize the data
GSE29617_set2 <- rma(GSE29617_affyBatch)
```

## Starting from the raw data

Let's check the results and compare to the expression matrix that was submitted to GEO
```{r}
exprs(GSE29617_set2)[1:2,1:2]
```

The rows are the features (i.e., probes). Columns are the samples.

## What are those probes?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# We first need to install our annotation package
library(BiocInstaller)
# Note that you don't have to use source anymore!
biocLite("hthgu133a.db")
```


```{r}
library(hthgu133a.db)
probe_ids <- rownames(GSE29617_set2)
probe_data <- select(hthgu133a.db, keys = probe_ids, columns = "SYMBOL", keytype = "PROBEID")
probe_data[1,]
```
This didn't work very well, did it?
The problem is that the probe IDs in hthgu133a.db have a different naming scheme than those in GSE29617_set2. This is fixed on the next slide.

## What are those probes?

Let's fix this: Replace _PM with <empty> for the probe id names in GSE29617_set2
```{r, warning=TRUE}
probe_ids <- gsub("_PM","", rownames(GSE29617_set2))
probe_data <- select(hthgu133a.db, keys = probe_ids, columns = "SYMBOL", keytype = "PROBEID")
probe_data[1, ]
```
What's the warning? Some probes match up with multiple genes, therefore those probe IDs will have more than one record.

## What are those probes?

This gives us too many rows, what do we do? Concatenate the gene names so that there will be one row per probe ID.

```{r}
library(data.table)
probe_data_dt <- data.table(probe_data)
probe_data_dt_unique <- probe_data_dt[,list(SYMBOL = paste(SYMBOL, collapse = ";")), by = "PROBEID"]
probe_data_dt_unique[SYMBOL %like% ";"]
```

## Completing our ExpressionSet

```{r}
annotaded_probes <- data.frame(probe_data_dt_unique)
rownames(annotaded_probes) <- rownames(GSE29617_set2)
fData(GSE29617_set2) <- annotaded_probes
head(fData(GSE29617_set2))
```


## Cleaning our metadata

```{r sanitize-pdata}
### Sanitize data and metadata
sanitize_pdata <- function(pd){
keepCols <- c(
  "characteristics_ch1.1", "characteristics_ch1.2",
  "description", 
  "supplementary_file")
pd <- pd[, keepCols]
colnames(pd) <- c("ptid", "time", "description", "filename")
pd$ptid <- gsub(".*: ", "", pd$ptid)
pd$time <- gsub(".*: ", "", pd$time)
pd$time <- gsub("Day", "D", pd$time)
pd$description <- gsub("(-\\w*){2}$", "", pd$description)
pd$filename <- basename(as.character(pd$filename))
pd$filename <- gsub(".CEL.gz", "", pd$filename)
pd
}
```

## Setting the metadata

```{r}
pData(GSE29617_set2) <- sanitize_pdata(pData(GSE29617_set))
pData(GSE29617_set2)[1:2, 1:2]
```

**Exercise:** Repeat this with a different accession number.

## GenomicRanges

Many genomic datasets rely of sets of coordinates, e.g. genes, exons, probes, genetic variants, etc

The `GenomicRanges` package was designed for these sets of coordinates.

Subsequeny slides borrow from https://www.bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2015/Uruguay2015/V3-GenomicRanges.html

## Motivation

Sequence analysis is specialized

- Large data needs to be processed in a memory- and time-efficient manner
- Specific algorithms have been developed for the unique
  characteristics of sequence data

Additional considerations

- Re-use of existing, tested code is easier to do and less error-prone
  than re-inventing the wheel.
- Interoperability between packages is easier when the packages share
  similar data structures.

Solution: use well-defined _classes_ to represent complex data;
_methods_ operate on the classes to perform useful functions.  Classes
and methods are placed together and distributed as _packages_ so that
we can all benefit from the hard work and tested code of others.

## IRanges: general class for ranges

The [IRanges][] package defines an important class for specifying
integer ranges, e.g.,
```{r iranges}
library(IRanges)
ir <- IRanges(start=c(10, 20, 30), width=5)
ir
```

Note these are more general than genomic ranges where ranges are usually relative to some chromosome, e.g. chr1:1-100 is different than chr2:1-100

## IRange operators
There are many interesting operations to be performed on ranges, e.g,
`flank()` identifies adjacent ranges
```{r iranges-flank}
flank(ir, 3)
```

## Genomic Ranges

The [GenomicRanges][] package extends the notion of ranges to include
features relevant to application of ranges in sequence analysis,
particularly the ability to associate a range with a sequence name
(e.g., chromosome) and a strand. Create a `GRanges` instance based on
our `IRanges` instance, as follows
```{r granges}
library(GenomicRanges)
gr <- GRanges(c("chr1", "chr1", "chr2"), ir, strand=c("+", "-", "+"))
gr
```

## IRanges versus GenomicRanges
The notion of flanking sequence has a more nuanced meaning in
biology. In particular we might expect that flanking sequence on the
`+` strand would precede the range, but on the minus strand would
follow it. Verify that `flank` applied to a `GRanges` object has this
behavior.
```{r granges-flank}
flank(gr, 3)
```

## GenomicRanges Methods
It seems like there might be a number of helpful methods available for
working with genomic ranges; we can discover some of these from the
command line, indicating that the methods should be on the current
`search()` path

```{r granges-methods}
methods(class="GRanges")
```

## GenomicRanges Methods

Use `help()` to list the help pages in the `GenomicRanges` package,
and `vignettes()` to view and access available vignettes; these are
also available in the Rstudio 'Help' tab.
```{r granges-man-and-vignettes, eval=FALSE}
help(package="GenomicRanges")
vignette(package="GenomicRanges")
vignette(package="GenomicRanges", "GenomicRangesHOWTOs")
```

## _GenomicRanges_

### The `GRanges` and `GRangesList` classes

Aside: 'TxDb' packages provide an R representation of gene models

```{r txdb}
library(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene)
txdb <- TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene
```

`exons()`: _GRanges_

```{r txdb-exons}
exons(txdb)
```

![Alt Genomic Ranges](our_figures/GRanges.png)

`exonsBy()`: _GRangesList_

```{r txdb-exonsby}
exonsBy(txdb, "tx")
```

![Alt Genomic Ranges List](our_figures/GRangesList.png)

_GRanges_ / _GRangesList_ are incredibly useful

- Represent **annotations** -- genes, variants, regulatory elements,
  copy number regions, ...
- Represent **data** -- aligned reads, ChIP peaks, called variants,
  ...

### Algebra of genomic ranges
  
Many biologically interesting questions represent operations on ranges

- Count overlaps between aligned reads and known genes --
  `GenomicRanges::summarizeOverlaps()`
- Genes nearest to regulatory regions -- `GenomicRanges::nearest()`,
  [ChIPseeker][]
- Called variants relevant to clinical phenotypes -- 
  [VariantFiltering][]

_GRanges_ Algebra

- Intra-range methods
    - Independent of other ranges in the same object
    - GRanges variants strand-aware
    - `shift()`, `narrow()`, `flank()`, `promoters()`, `resize()`,
      `restrict()`, `trim()`
    - See `?"intra-range-methods"`
- Inter-range methods
    - Depends on other ranges in the same object
    - `range()`, `reduce()`, `gaps()`, `disjoin()`
    - `coverage()` (!)
    - see `?"inter-range-methods"`
- Between-range methods
    - Functions of two (or more) range objects
    - `findOverlaps()`, `countOverlaps()`, ..., `%over%`, `%within%`,
      `%outside%`; `union()`, `intersect()`, `setdiff()`, `punion()`,
      `pintersect()`, `psetdiff()`

![Alt Ranges Algebra](our_figures/RangeOperations.png)

## _Biostrings_ (DNA or amino acid sequences)

Classes

- XString, XStringSet, e.g., DNAString (genomes),
  DNAStringSet (reads)

Methods --

- [Cheat sheat](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/Biostrings/inst/doc/BiostringsQuickOverview.pdf)
- Manipulation, e.g., `reverseComplement()`
- Summary, e.g., `letterFrequency()`
- Matching, e.g., `matchPDict()`, `matchPWM()`

Related packages

- [BSgenome][]
  - Whole-genome representations
  - Model and custom
- [ShortRead][]
  - FASTQ files

Example 

- Whole-genome sequences are distrubuted by ENSEMBL, NCBI, and others
  as FASTA files; model organism whole genome sequences are packaged
  into more user-friendly `BSgenome` packages. The following
  calculates GC content across chr14.

    ```{r BSgenome-require, message=FALSE}
    library(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19)
    chr14_range = GRanges("chr14", IRanges(1, seqlengths(Hsapiens)["chr14"]))
    chr14_dna <- getSeq(Hsapiens, chr14_range)
    letterFrequency(chr14_dna, "GC", as.prob=TRUE)
    ```
    
## _GenomicAlignments_ (Aligned reads)

Classes -- GenomicRanges-like behaivor

- GAlignments, GAlignmentPairs, GAlignmentsList

Methods

- `readGAlignments()`, `readGAlignmentsList()`
  - Easy to restrict input, iterate in chunks
- `summarizeOverlaps()`

Example

- Find reads supporting the junction identified above, at position
  19653707 + 66M = 19653773 of chromosome 14

    ```{r bam-require}
    library(GenomicRanges)
    library(GenomicAlignments)
    library(Rsamtools)
    
    ## our 'region of interest'
    roi <- GRanges("chr14", IRanges(19653773, width=1)) 
    ## sample data
    library('RNAseqData.HNRNPC.bam.chr14')
    bf <- BamFile(RNAseqData.HNRNPC.bam.chr14_BAMFILES[[1]], asMates=TRUE)
    ## alignments, junctions, overlapping our roi
    paln <- readGAlignmentsList(bf)
    j <- summarizeJunctions(paln, with.revmap=TRUE)
    j_overlap <- j[j %over% roi]
    
    ## supporting reads
    paln[j_overlap$revmap[[1]]]
    ```

## _VariantAnnotation_ (Called variants)

Classes -- GenomicRanges-like behavior

- VCF -- 'wide'
- VRanges -- 'tall'

Functions and methods

- I/O and filtering: `readVcf()`, `readGeno()`, `readInfo()`,
  `readGT()`, `writeVcf()`, `filterVcf()`
- Annotation: `locateVariants()` (variants overlapping ranges),
  `predictCoding()`, `summarizeVariants()`
- SNPs: `genotypeToSnpMatrix()`, `snpSummary()`

Example

- Read variants from a VCF file, and annotate with respect to a known
  gene model
  
    ```{r vcf, message=FALSE}
    ## input variants
    library(VariantAnnotation)
    fl <- system.file("extdata", "chr22.vcf.gz", package="VariantAnnotation")
    vcf <- readVcf(fl, "hg19")
    seqlevels(vcf) <- "chr22"
    ## known gene model
    library(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene)
    coding <- locateVariants(rowRanges(vcf),
        TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene,
        CodingVariants())
    head(coding)
    ```

- Typically, sorted (by position) and indexed ('.bai' files)

[GenomicAlignments][]

- Use an example BAM file (`fl` could be the path to your own BAM file)

    ```{r genomicalignments}
    ## example BAM data
    library(RNAseqData.HNRNPC.bam.chr14)
    ## one BAM file
    fl <- RNAseqData.HNRNPC.bam.chr14_BAMFILES[1]
    ## Let R know that this is a BAM file, not just a character vector
    library(Rsamtools)
    bfl <- BamFile(fl)
    ```
- Input the data into R

    ```{r readgalignments}
    aln <- readGAlignments(bfl)
    aln
    ```

    - `readGAlignmentPairs()` / `readGAlignmentsList()` if paired-end
      data
    - Lots of things to do, including all the _GRanges_ /
      _GRangesList_ operations
      
    ```{r galignments-methods}
    methods(class=class(aln))
    ```

- **Caveat emptor**: BAM files are large. Normally you will
  _restrict_ the input to particular genomic ranges, or _iterate_
  through the BAM file. Key _Bioconductor_ functions (e.g.,
  `GenomicAlignments::summarizeOverlaps()` do this data management
  step for you. See next section!
